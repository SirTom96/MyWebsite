# MyWebsite

This is the whole code of my personal Website, you can look it at https://sirtom96.github.io/MyWebsite/MyWebsite/index.html.

For coding the site i used HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
I used JavaScript ECMASCRIPT2015, also known as ES6.
ES6 added some new features such as arrow functions, "let" command and more.
Documentation about ES6 at https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp
